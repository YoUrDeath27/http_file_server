this is my http_file_server, made by me, debugged by me, researched by me, and improved by me
this is still a wrok in progress, but if u are interested in helping with making this better or adding a function for it, 
feel free to copy the repository and when u are done to push to a branch, im going to review your changes, and i will decide wether its worth it or not

otherwise the server is quite simple

it just listens to the Url u chose for a client and then it sends a webpage to him
(idk what else to say)

in the future im planning to implement:
  - multi-threading
  - better UI (styling)
